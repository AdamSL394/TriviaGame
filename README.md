# TriviaGame
This repo shows the use of Javascript and Jquery used together to make dynamic elements. We have classified out quesiton variable into a object that has the answers as an array. We cycle throught the answers array and creat a button for each index. We are creating, adding attributes, classes, and bringing them to the page in Javascript.After the start button is pressed we  ollow the quesition index brining up each quesiton and rendering text depending on the users choice (right or wrong) or indecison. We ake the data-name on from (*this) click and match it to the object key and the correct answer value. The game incorporates a timer that is set to an Interval of 1 second and refreshed on every question. In between we set a timeout  to show the correct answer before we render the next question. At the end the users score is displayed and a restart game button pops up
